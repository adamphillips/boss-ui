# Boss-UI

This is a derivative of [Bliss UI](https://github.com/saadq/bliss-ui) tweaked to my own personal preference. Feel free to use it but be warned it may change at any time according to my whimsies.

### Installation

```
$ apm install adamphillips/boss-ui
```

### Setup
1. Go to your `Preferences` and click on `Themes` in the sidebar.
2. Click on the `Syntax Theme` dropdown and change the value to `Boss`.

### Credits
This theme is a lightly tweaked version of [Bliss UI](https://github.com/saadq/bliss-ui) which is in turn a fork of the awesome [apex-ui](https://github.com/apex/apex-ui) theme created by [TJ Holowaychuk](https://github.com/tj).
